<p>Today I discovered <a href="https://supunkavinda.blog/disqus">this blog post</a> on Hacker News. It describes the Disqus commenting system - and it gave me the jeebies. Disqus is disabled from this site effective immediately.</p>

<p>It's not like I'm running this site for the clicks anyway. :-)</p>
