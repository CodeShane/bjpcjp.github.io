<p>Like many Ruby on Rails developers, I dove into Rails first. Over the years I've backfilled my basic Ruby knowledge (the Pickaxe book was great), but I've never felt like a real practitioner. This is a first attempt to fill that hole.</p>

<p>Today I pushed a series of Jupyter Lab notebooks, covering The Well-Grounded Rubyist, to Github. Each notebook is running a Ruby 2.7.0 kernel. I'm happy with my progress thus far but know that considerable cleanup awaits.</p>
