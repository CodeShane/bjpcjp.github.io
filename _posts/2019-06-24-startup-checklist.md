I’ve been tinkering with different startup ideas and needed a good checklist to think through them. There are great templates for this already: [The YC application](https://apply.ycombinator.com/), Amazon’s [internal press release](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management/answer/Ian-McAllister), and Sequoia’s [Writing a Business Plan](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/writing-a-business-plan/). I found myself mixing and tweaking these templates because they don’t exactly match my model of the world, so I wrote up my own list.

I use this list both to develop ideas and filter them. If you adopt it, be careful about using it as a filter. __Remember: in the early stages, good ideas are very easy to kill.__

Product
=======

1.  __Who are the users?__
    <= 70 chars
    
    
2.  __What is the essence of their dissatisfaction?__ If they read this answer, would they say “thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way”?  
    <= 240 chars  
    [@benedictevans](https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1110538673873805314): “The iTunes Store solved a user problem. So did the App Store. And so did Spotify and Apple Music, and indeed Apple News. But what user problem is solved by Apple’s commissioning TV shows?”
    
    
3.  __What are you building for them?__
    <= 70 chars  
    [Peter Drucker](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459/): Is the product being designed **for** the customer, or **at** the customer?
    
    
4.  __Write a tweet from a hypothetical customer explaining the product and how it eliminates their dissatisfaction.__  
    [@BrianNorgard](https://twitter.com/BrianNorgard/status/1110915013085028353): No one cares about your product. Who built it, its features, the origin story — it’s all superfluous. People only find value in what your product can do for them right now. Save people time. Save people money. Give people an escape. The selfish hand will always govern.  
    
    
    [Peter Drucker](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459/): Are you **really** doing the best you can to help the customer?
    
    
5.  __Write a blog post title for your product launch.__ Is it surprising? Is it new? Will your target customers want to click on it? Will they want to share the link? Will they still share it the next day?  
    <= 70 chars
    
    
6.  __Write the first paragraph of your product announcement blog post.__ Include the product name, an explanation of what the product is, the target market, the main benefit, and the call to action.  
    <= 240 chars
    
    
7.  __What “metrics of goodness” do your target customers care about?__ Does your product dominate every available alternative on these metrics?  
    <= 240 chars
