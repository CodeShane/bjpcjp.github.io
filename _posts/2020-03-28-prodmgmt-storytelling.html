I used to market electronic components to B2B customers. It was, to be succinct,
a miserable way to look for a daily affirmation.<br><br>
It took years to learn how to search for those little sparks of emotional connection with one of the most rational, "just give me the specs and prices" 
cohorts on the planet.<br><br>
So I started collecting storytelling primers. I hope you find them useful.

		Kurt Vonnegut's 8 Short Story Tips (Open Culture)</a><br><br>
		<em>
			* Respect the reader's time.<br>
			* Provide at least one character the reader can root for.<br>
			* Every character should want something, even if only a glass of water.<br>
			* Every sentence must either reveal character or advance the action.<br>
			* Start as close to the end as possible.<br>
			* Be a sadist. Make awful things happen to your characters. Show the reader what they are made of.<br>
			* Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, your story will get pneumonia.<br>
			* Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense.

			Breaking Bad's 5-Part Story Structures (Vox)</a><br><br>
			<em>"...The main difference (vs 3-part movie plots) is time. You’ll notice the shape is roughly the same, but the five-act structure gives both the buildup to and fall from the climax whole acts to breathe. Instead of getting stuck in a never-ending second act, much of the story is pushed to the fourth act, or the fallout from the big moment. And on TV, time is everything."

			Pixar's Story Rules (PixarTouchBook)</a><br><br>
			<em>
				* You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.<br>
				* Remember what’s interesting to you as an audience, not as a writer.<br>
				* Theme is important, but you won’t see what the story is really about til you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.<br>
				* Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.<br>
				* Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.<br>
				* What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?<br>
				* Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.<br>
				* Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.<br>
				* When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.<br>
				* Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.<br>
				* Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it.<br>
				* Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. Get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.<br>
				* Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable, but it’s poison to the audience.<br>
				* Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.<br>
				* If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.<br>
				* What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. Stack the odds.<br>
				* No work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, move on - it’ll be useful later.<br>
				* You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining.<br>
				* Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.<br>
				* Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How'd you rearrange them into what you DO like?<br>
				* You gotta identify with your situation - you can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way?<br>
				* What’s the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.<br>
