		Kurt Vonnegut's 8 Short Story Tips (Open Culture)</a><br><br>
		<em>
			* Use the time of a total stranger such that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.<br>
			* Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.<br>
			* Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.<br>
			* Every sentence must either reveal character or advance the action.<br>
			* Start as close to the end as possible.<br>
			* Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them--in order that the reader may see what they are made of.<br>
			* Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.<br>
			* Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense.

			<em>
				* Never open a book with weather.<br>
				* Avoid prologues.<br>
				* Never use a verb other then "said" to carry dialogue.<br>
				* Never use an adverb to modify "said".<br>
				* Keep your exclamation points ­under control.<br>
				* Never use "suddenly" or "all hell broke loose".<br>
				* Use regional dialect, patois, sparingly.<br>
				* Avoid detailed descriptions of characters.<br>
				* Don't go into great detail describing places and things.<br>
				* Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.<br>
				* (summary: if it sounds like writing, rewrite it.)

			Pixar's Story Rules (PixarTouchBook)</a><br><br>
			<em>
				* 1: You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.<br>
				* 2: Remember what’s interesting to you as an audience, not as a writer.<br>
				* 3: Theme is important, but you won’t see what the story is really about til you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.<br>
				* 4: Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.<br>
				* 5: Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.<br>
				* 6: What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?<br>
				* 7: Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.<br>
				* 8: Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.<br>
				* 9: When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.<br>
				* 10: Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.<br>
				* 11: Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it.<br>
				* 12: Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. Get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.<br>
				* 13: Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable, but it’s poison to the audience.<br>
				* 14: Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.<br>
				* 15: If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.<br>
				* 16: What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. Stack the odds against.<br>
				* 17: No work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, move on - it’ll be useful later.<br>
				* 18: You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining.<br>
				* 19: Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.<br>
				* 20: Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d’you rearrange them into what you DO like?<br>
				* 21: You gotta identify with your situation - you can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way?<br>
				* 22: What’s the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.<br>
