I'll be moving content from my Google Keep account over the coming weeks so that it can be shared with the public. Here's the types of material that's queued up:

* <strong>Machine Learning</strong>: I've got a <strong>ton</strong> of books.
* <strong>Math (for Machine Learning)</strong>: Ditto.
* <strong>Product Management</strong>: I've already posted a <cite>looooooooong</cite> list of curated bookmarks. Next up: a list of <strong>customer behaviors</strong>, also in the form of a curated bookmark list.
* <strong>Game Theory</strong>: Collected notes from my copy of <cite>Games of Strategy</cite>.
* <strong>UI/UX</strong>: Stay tuned.
* <strong>Semiconductors & related Electronics</strong>: Ditto.
