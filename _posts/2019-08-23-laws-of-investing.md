#### __Law #1:__ Optimism and pessimism will always overshoot because the boundaries of both can only be known in hindsight, once they’re passed.

#### __Law #2:__ Calm plants the seeds of crazy.

#### __Law #3:__ Career realities create a mismatch between cash flows and time horizon, antagonizing the power of compounding.

#### __Law #4:__ People with different time horizons and different goals want different things out of the same asset, creating reasonable differences in opinion that can be misinterpreted as disagreements.

#### __Law #5:__ Luck and risk are the opposite sides of the same coin but we treat them very differently.

#### __Law #6:__ The biggest risk is always whatever no one is talking about, because if no one’s talking about it they’re not prepared for it.

#### __Law #7:__ Narratives become self-fulfilling and can override visible capabilities that are easier to measure.

#### __Law #8:__ Technology will be ridiculed proportionally to how groundbreaking it is because it’s hard to distinguish familiarity from utility.

#### __Law #9:__ Big results are driven by tail events, so winning while losing much of the time is normal.

#### __Law #10:__ Effective strategies change as the metrics investors care about evolve.

#### __Law #11:__ The most persuasive evidence is what you want to be true and/or have experienced personally.

#### __Law #12:__ A gap between the timing of investment opportunities and faith in an investment manager will influence professional investment decisions.

#### __Law #13:__ Diagnosis errors creating a tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.

#### __Law #14:__ Speculation is rational because low-probability events can be massively rewarding when leverage and huge sums of money are involved.

#### __Law #15:__ Behavior > analytics, because one can’t be taught and the other can.

#### __Law #16:__ An attachment to investment entertainment because money is a universal product with powerful tail-driven anecdotal stories and emotions that are easily triggered.

#### __Law #17:__ The humble math of savings, fees, and taxes.
