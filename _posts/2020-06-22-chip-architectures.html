	<strong>Key points:</strong><br>
	- Most speedup comes from parallelism enabled by specialization - the main source of efficiency.<br>
	- Underlying algorithms are volatile - trading hardware-friendly computation for reduced memory bandwidth.<br>
	- Accelerator design is really parallel programming with a cost model forcing function. Math is free. Global memory is expensive.<br>
	- Memory dominates area & power of domain-specific processors.<br>
	- Specialized instructions leverage the advantage of a DSA at a fraction of the development cost.<br>
	- DSAs are of the few ways to continue scaling & efficiency.<br>
