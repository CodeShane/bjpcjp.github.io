title: The Psychology of Predictions

[original](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-prediction/)

1. The distinction between “wrong” vs. “early” has less to do with analytics than the social ability to prevent listeners from giving up on you.

2. Credibility is not impartial: Your willingness to believe a prediction is influenced by how much you need that prediction to be true.

3. History is the study of surprising events. Prediction is using historical data to forecast what events will happen next.

4. Predictions are easiest to make when patterns are strong and have been around for a long time – which is often when those patterns are about to expire.

5. Prediction is about probability and putting the odds of success in your favor. But observers mostly judge you in binary terms, right or wrong.

6. Past predictions that end up on the unfortunate side of probabilistic odds might cause hesitancy to make more predictions in the future.

7. Predictions are often calibrated to promote or preserve your reputation and career goals.

8. Enough effort goes into an initial forecast that updating your views when new information becomes available can trigger the sunk-cost fallacy and cause you to be right or wrong for the wrong reason.

9. Predicting the behavior of other people relies on understanding their motivations, incentives, social norms and how all those things change. That can be difficult if you are not a member of that group and have a different set of life experiences.

10. Some predictions are intellectual stimulation and don’t need to be acted upon even if they’re right.

11. If you refuse to make predictions because you know how hard they are you may become suspect of everyone else’s predictions even if they have insight and skills you don’t.

12. Effort put into a prediction may increase confidence more than accuracy.
