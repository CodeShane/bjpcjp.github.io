</span> <span class="chip annotation WEBLINK"><a title="You are driving down the road in heavy traffic. Your lane is moving slowly. So you switch to the other lane that seemed to move faster. But after some time, you realize that the previous lane is now moving faster. Annoyed and confused, you think no more and decide to just stay where you are. Or should you switch again? Mr. Zollman, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University, lectures on Game Theory: &ldquo;Game theory is a mathematical theory aimed at understanding strategic situations &ndash; situations where how well one person does depends on what others do, and vice versa. Chess, poker and football all fit into this category, but so do more weighty decisions like investing, deciding who to marry and deciding what job to take.&rdquo; Game theory helps to analyze competitive situations in a structured way. For a situation to be considered as a game there should be at least two rational players who formulate their strategies by taking into account their opponents&rsquo; reaction to those strategies. Game theory has its application in a wide range of strategic decision making areas like economics, politics, sports, wars, etc but we will limit our study to our area of interest and look into applying game theory to business decision making and strategic pricing. Let us understand the concept of game theory using the following business problem and later delve into its application on pricing strategies. We first look at a scenario of Simultaneous Game. In a simultaneous game, two or more brands have to make a decision simultaneously without knowing what the other brands are doing, but are aware that they will also act rationally. Two Brands, A and B, are top brands selling shampoo. Both the brands consider launching an advertising campaign. They have to make a decision on whether to advertise or not, not only by weighing their payoffs, but also considering that their opponent may or may not launch a campaign itself. The game-setting is as follows: &ndash;          Scenario: Brand A and Brand B share the market equally with total sales of 20 million dollars. The cost of launching the campaign is 5 million dollars. The campaign will not increase the market size and total sales, as people will not start washing their hair more because of the advertisement; it will however increase the market share of the brand to 80%. &ndash;          Players: Brand A and Brand B &ndash;          Actions: To advertise or not to advertise &ndash;          Rules: Both brands have to decide simultaneously &ndash;          Payoffs: If both advertise: Each earn 10mn (Value Sales)-5mn (Campaign Cost) = $5 mn If both do not advertise : Each earn $10mn If only one brand advertises: The advertiser earns 0.8*20 -5 =$11mn. Non-advertiser earns 20 -0.8*20 = $4mn.   This is an example of a bi-matrix game, where there are two players who effectively make their move simultaneously without knowing the other player&rsquo;s actions. Each cell in the matrix represents the payoff of the row player (first number) and the column player (second number). The matrix of the above game can be represented as shown. Now let&rsquo;s play the game and find a strategic solution. Each of the brands will choose its dominant strategy and will eliminate the dominated strategy. A dominant strategy for one player is the best strategy, regardless of what its rival plays. A dominated strategy is the worst strategy, regardless of what its rival plays. Let us have a look from Brand A&rsquo;s perspective: &ndash;          If Brand B chooses to advertise, the best strategy for Brand A will be to advertise as advertising will fetch them 5mn while not advertising will fetch them only $4 mn. &ndash;          If Brand B chooses not to advertise, the best strategy for Brand A will be to advertise as advertising will fetch them $11mn while not advertising will fetch them only $10 mn.    Hence, in this game, regardless of what Brand B does, Brand A should choose to advertise. Similarly, if we look from Brand B&rsquo;s perspective, the best strategy for Brand B will be to advertise regardless of what Brand A does. So the outcome of the game would be that both brands choose to advertise and earn $5mn profit each. With this, we have arrived at a point from which no brand has an incentive to deviate to improve its payoffs, considering the other brand is also thinking rationally. This state is called as Nash-Equilibrium. Interestingly, you would observe that this is not an optimum solution. From the matrix you can see that if both firms choose not to advertise they both will end up earning $10mn of profit each, instead of $5mn. A Nash-Equilibrium is different from an optimal solution. But why is Nash-Equilibrium the best solution? The situation is of competition and not of cooperation. Considering the optimal solution, if Brand A chooses not to advertise, it should not assume that Brand B also will not advertise. Brand B has the incentive to advertise and earn $11mn profit against $10mn. So Brand A is compelled to take its decision considering that Brand B will advertise. This interesting situation is termed as Prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma which considers that two rational players might not cooperate even if it appears that it is in their best interest. In the next part of the blog, we will understand how the Game Theory can be applied in making decisions on pricing strategies. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.

</span> <span class="chip annotation WEBLINK"><a title="In the first part of this blog, we introduced the concept of Game Theory. We will now see how we can apply the game theory in pricing strategy. Let us look into a slightly complex pricing problem. Coffee S and Coffee B are in competition with each other near a college campus. They have to decide what price they should charge, considering they have a competitor. The game-setting is as follows: Scenario: There are 1000 students in the college. 300 go only to Coffee S and other 300 go only to Coffee B. Remaining 400 go to whichever is cheaper. Players:  Coffee S and Coffee B Actions: The coffee shops have the options to choose high ($10), medium ($8) and low ($5) price for a cup of coffee. Rules: They both have to decide on price simultaneously. Payoffs: The calculations for payoffs can be easily done and are shown in matrix. For example, if one coffee shop charges a high price and the other a medium price, the payoff for the shop charging high price will be 300*10 = 3 thousand dollars and for the shop charging medium price will be (300+400)*8=5.6 thousand dollars. If both charge the same price, the payoffs will be equally divided. The matrix can be shown as given. We solve the matrix with the same approach we used in the previous blog, by eliminating the dominated strategy and choosing the dominant strategy. Can you find out the Nash-Equilibrium? If you have come up with the strategy that both Coffee S and Coffee B should set a medium price, then bingo! There can be situations when a firm can act before the other. So the second firm is able to play the game knowing what the first firm has done. The first firm has to make the decision without the requisite knowledge of the follower and knowing that it will react rationally. Such games are called Sequential Games. Let us understand such a game using an example from pricing perspective. Soft Drink Firm P is having a monopoly in soft drinks market. A new firm, Firm C, is considering entering the Soft Drink market. Firm C has to make the decision whether to charge a high price or a low price for its product. To solve the problem of sequential games, we follow the method of Backward Induction. In Backward Induction, a decision tree is made with each outcome&rsquo;s payoffs mentioned. For the above problem, the decision tree can be represented as shown.   The given payoffs are the profits that the firms will make for the corresponding outcome. Applying backward induction, we will first see how Firm P will react to Firm C&rsquo;s pricing. If Firm C chooses a high price, Firm P can choose a high price and earn $8mn profit or a low price and earn $10mn profits. So rationally, Firm P will choose a low price. On the other hand, If Firm C chooses a low price, Firm P can choose a high price and earn no profit or a low price and earn $5mn profits. So rationally, Firm P will choose a low price. Now, keeping in mind Firm P&rsquo;s rational decision, Firm C will take a step back. It can choose either to keep a high price or a low price. If it chooses a high price, it will end up earning $0mn profit. If it chooses a low price, it will end up earning $5mn profit. So Firm C will choose a low price as it will anticipate that Firm P will choose a low price. This, again, is a state of Nash Equilibrium. So the outcome of the game is that both Firms should charge a low price for their products.    The same concepts can be applied to an n-person game which is played not once but over and over, or continuously, for a long time. You, as one player, observe what the other players are doing and alter your play accordingly. You keep changing your play until no further change will make you better off. All the other players do the same. Equilibrium is finally reached when each player has chosen a strategy that is optimal for him, given the strategies that the other players are following. Remember the predicament mentioned in the previous blog where you were still deciding whether to switch the lane again or not?  Now try solving the situation using the theory of sequential game and happily avoid traveling in a slow lane!
